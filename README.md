My attempt at building a responsive website for Grow with google.

I started with css grids and am now trying to make them responsive.  

I have used grid layouts from codepen https://codepen.io/bymushfiq/pen/paBBJz

and responsive design items from https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/common-responsive-layouts-with-css-grid-and-some-without-245a862f48df

I also used my own https://codepen.io/danelleblack/pen/odWgRw with help from the original codepen for svg hamburger menu but abandoned the menu option after trouble with responsiveness.  

here are some versions:
